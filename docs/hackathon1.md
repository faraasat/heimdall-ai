# Deriv AI Talent Sprint

A hackathon for builders ready to shape real AI solutions

Join Deriv and lablab.ai for a high-intensity hybrid hackathon where top builders create AI prototypes, demo their work, and get fast-tracked to interviews.

## CHALLENGE

### Build a job-ready AI prototype with a clear real-world use case

Your mission is simple: build and demo a real AI product prototype in a way that demonstrates strong execution, clear thinking, and team delivery.

What you need to deliver

By the end of the hackathon, your team should have:

✅ A working demo (something we can run and test)
✅ A clear problem statement (what you’re solving and for who)
✅ A solution flow (how the user interacts with it, end-to-end)
✅ Solid implementation (clean, maintainable code and sound architecture)
✅ A short presentation (what you built, how it works, why it matters)

What you can build

Pick one direction and go deep. Examples include:

- AI workflow assistants (automation, internal tools, triage, knowledge support)
- Data & insights tools (dashboards, monitoring, anomaly detection, forecasting)
- QA & engineering automation (test generation, bug triage, regression detection)
- Risk / security / compliance support (alerts, auditing flows, policy enforcement)

### AI pentester

What you’ll build: Continuously discover and assess security vulnerabilities across the organisation’s attack surface using AI agents. Continuous pentesting that never sleeps.

What will blow our minds: A system that discovers zero-day vulnerabilities through creative AI reasoning. Continuous pentesting that tests endpoints faster and more thoroughly than human pentesters while dramatically reducing costs.
